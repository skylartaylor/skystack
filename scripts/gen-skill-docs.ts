If output shows \`UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>\`: read \`~/.claude/skills/skystack/skystack-upgrade/SKILL.md\` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If \`JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>\`: tell user "Running skystack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the \`_BRANCH\` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** \`RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]\` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts when the delta is small. Include \`Completeness: X/10\` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: \`A) ... B) ... C) ...\` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: \`(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)\`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Contributor Mode

If \`_CONTRIB\` is \`true\`: at the end of each major workflow step, rate the skystack experience 0 to 10. Not a 10? File a report at \`~/.skystack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md\` (skip if exists, max 3/session, file inline, tell user "Filed skystack field report: {title}"):

\`\`\`
# {Title}
**What I was trying to do:** {action}
**What happened instead:** {result}
**My rating:** {0-10} — {why not a 10}
**What would make this a 10:** {one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
\`\`\`

Calibration — this is the bar: \`$B js "await fetch(...)"\` failing with a SyntaxError because skystack didn't wrap it in async context = worth filing. App bugs, auth failures, or network errors to user's URLs = NOT worth filing.`;

function generateQAMethodology(): string {
  return `## Modes

### Diff-aware (automatic when on a feature branch with no URL)

This is the **primary mode** for developers verifying their work. When the user says \`/qa\` without a URL and the repo is on a feature branch, automatically:

1. **Analyze the branch diff** to understand what changed:
   \`\`\`bash
   git diff main...HEAD --name-only
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   \`\`\`

2. **Identify affected pages/routes** from the changed files:
   - Controller/route files → which URL paths they serve
   - View/template/component files → which pages render them
   - Model/service files → which pages use those models (check controllers that reference them)
   - CSS/style files → which pages include those stylesheets
   - API endpoints → test them directly with \`$B js "await fetch('/api/...')"\`
   - Static pages (markdown, HTML) → navigate to them directly

3. **Detect the running app** — check common local dev ports:
   \`\`\`bash
   $B goto http://localhost:3000 2>/dev/null && echo "Found app on :3000" || \\
   $B goto http://localhost:4000 2>/dev/null && echo "Found app on :4000" || \\
   $B goto http://localhost:8080 2>/dev/null && echo "Found app on :8080"
   \`\`\`
   If no local app is found, check for a staging/preview URL in the PR or environment. If nothing works, ask the user for the URL.

4. **Test each affected page/route:**
   - Navigate to the page
   - Take a screenshot
   - Check console for errors
   - If the change was interactive (forms, buttons, flows), test the interaction end-to-end
   - Use \`snapshot -D\` before and after actions to verify the change had the expected effect

5. **Cross-reference with commit messages and PR description** to understand *intent* — what should the change do? Verify it actually does that.

6. **Check TODOS.md** (if it exists) for known bugs or issues related to the changed files. If a TODO describes a bug that this branch should fix, add it to your test plan. If you find a new bug during QA that isn't in TODOS.md, note it in the report.

7. **Report findings** scoped to the branch changes:
   - "Changes tested: N pages/routes affected by this branch"
   - For each: does it work? Screenshot evidence.
   - Any regressions on adjacent pages?

**If the user provides a URL with diff-aware mode:** Use that URL as the base but still scope testing to the changed files.

### Full (default when URL is provided)
Systematic exploration. Visit every reachable page. Document 5-10 well-evidenced issues. Produce health score. Takes 5-15 minutes depending on app size.

### Quick (\`--quick\`)
30-second smoke test. Visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets. Check: page loads? Console errors? Broken links? Produce health score. No detailed issue documentation.

### Regression (\`--regression <baseline>\`)
Run full mode, then load \`baseline.json\` from a previous run. Diff: which issues are fixed? Which are new? What's the score delta? Append regression section to report.

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialize

1. Find browse binary (see Setup above)
2. Create output directories
3. Copy report template from \`qa/templates/qa-report-template.md\` to output dir
4. Start timer for duration tracking

### Phase 2: Authenticate (if needed)

**If the user specified auth credentials:**

\`\`\`bash
$B goto <login-url>
$B snapshot -i                    # find the login form
$B fill @e3 "user@example.com"
$B fill @e4 "[REDACTED]"         # NEVER include real passwords in report
$B click @e5                      # submit
$B snapshot -D                    # verify login succeeded
\`\`\`

**If the user provided a cookie file:**

\`\`\`bash
$B cookie-import cookies.json
$B goto <target-url>
\`\`\`

**If 2FA/OTP is required:** Ask the user for the code and wait.

**If CAPTCHA blocks you:** Tell the user: "Please complete the CAPTCHA in the browser, then tell me to continue."

### Phase 3: Orient

Get a map of the application:

\`\`\`bash
$B goto <target-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/initial.png"
$B links                          # map navigation structure
$B console --errors               # any errors on landing?
\`\`\`

**Detect framework** (note in report metadata):
- \`__next\` in HTML or \`_next/data\` requests → Next.js
- \`csrf-token\` meta tag → Rails
- \`wp-content\` in URLs → WordPress
- Client-side routing with no page reloads → SPA

**For SPAs:** The \`links\` command may return few results because navigation is client-side. Use \`snapshot -i\` to find nav elements (buttons, menu items) instead.

### Phase 4: Explore

Visit pages systematically. At each page:

\`\`\`bash
$B goto <page-url>
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-name.png"
$B console --errors
\`\`\`

Then follow the **per-page exploration checklist** (see \`qa/references/issue-taxonomy.md\`):

1. **Visual scan** — Look at the annotated screenshot for layout issues
2. **Interactive elements** — Click buttons, links, controls. Do they work?
3. **Forms** — Fill and submit. Test empty, invalid, edge cases
4. **Navigation** — Check all paths in and out
5. **States** — Empty state, loading, error, overflow
6. **Console** — Any new JS errors after interactions?
7. **Responsiveness** — Check mobile viewport if relevant:
   \`\`\`bash
   $B viewport 375x812
   $B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-mobile.png"
   $B viewport 1280x720
   \`\`\`

**Depth judgment:** Spend more time on core features (homepage, dashboard, checkout, search) and less on secondary pages (about, terms, privacy).

**Quick mode:** Only visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets from the Orient phase. Skip the per-page checklist — just check: loads? Console errors? Broken links visible?

### Phase 5: Document

Document each issue **immediately when found** — don't batch them.

**Two evidence tiers:**

**Interactive bugs** (broken flows, dead buttons, form failures):
1. Take a screenshot before the action
2. Perform the action
3. Take a screenshot showing the result
4. Use \`snapshot -D\` to show what changed
5. Write repro steps referencing screenshots

\`\`\`bash
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-step-1.png"
$B click @e5
$B screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-result.png"
$B snapshot -D
\`\`\`

**Static bugs** (typos, layout issues, missing images):
1. Take a single annotated screenshot showing the problem
2. Describe what's wrong

\`\`\`bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-002.png"
\`\`\`

**Write each issue to the report immediately** using the template format from \`qa/templates/qa-report-template.md\`.

### Phase 6: Wrap Up

1. **Compute health score** using the rubric below
2. **Write "Top 3 Things to Fix"** — the 3 highest-severity issues
3. **Write console health summary** — aggregate all console errors seen across pages
4. **Update severity counts** in the summary table
5. **Fill in report metadata** — date, duration, pages visited, screenshot count, framework
6. **Save baseline** — write \`baseline.json\` with:
   \`\`\`json
   {
     "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "url": "<target>",
     "healthScore": N,
     "issues": [{ "id": "ISSUE-001", "title": "...", "severity": "...", "category": "..." }],
     "categoryScores": { "console": N, "links": N, ... }
   }
   \`\`\`

**Regression mode:** After writing the report, load the baseline file. Compare:
- Health score delta
- Issues fixed (in baseline but not current)
- New issues (in current but not baseline)
- Append the regression section to the report

---

## Health Score Rubric

Compute each category score (0-100), then take the weighted average.

### Console (weight: 15%)
- 0 errors → 100
- 1-3 errors → 70
- 4-10 errors → 40
- 10+ errors → 10

### Links (weight: 10%)
- 0 broken → 100
- Each broken link → -15 (minimum 0)

### Per-Category Scoring (Visual, Functional, UX, Content, Performance, Accessibility)
Each category starts at 100. Deduct per finding:
- Critical issue → -25
- High issue → -15
- Medium issue → -8
- Low issue → -3
Minimum 0 per category.

### Weights
| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Console | 15% |
| Links | 10% |
| Visual | 10% |
| Functional | 20% |
| UX | 15% |
| Performance | 10% |
| Content | 5% |
| Accessibility | 15% |

### Final Score
\`score = Σ (category_score × weight)\`

---

## Framework-Specific Guidance

### Next.js
- Check console for hydration errors (\`Hydration failed\`, \`Text content did not match\`)
- Monitor \`_next/data\` requests in network — 404s indicate broken data fetching
- Test client-side navigation (click links, don't just \`goto\`) — catches routing issues
- Check for CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) on pages with dynamic content

### Rails
- Check for N+1 query warnings in console (if development mode)
- Verify CSRF token presence in forms
- Test Turbo/Stimulus integration — do page transitions work smoothly?
- Check for flash messages appearing and dismissing correctly

### WordPress
- Check for plugin conflicts (JS errors from different plugins)
- Verify admin bar visibility for logged-in users
- Test REST API endpoints (\`/wp-json/\`)
- Check for mixed content warnings (common with WP)

### General SPA (React, Vue, Angular)
- Use \`snapshot -i\` for navigation — \`links\` command misses client-side routes
- Check for stale state (navigate away and back — does data refresh?)
- Test browser back/forward — does the app handle history correctly?
- Check for memory leaks (monitor console after extended use)

---

## Important Rules

1. **Repro is everything.** Every issue needs at least one screenshot. No exceptions.
2. **Verify before documenting.** Retry the issue once to confirm it's reproducible, not a fluke.
3. **Never include credentials.** Write \`[REDACTED]\` for passwords in repro steps.
4. **Write incrementally.** Append each issue to the report as you find it. Don't batch.
5. **Never read source code.** Test as a user, not a developer.
6. **Check console after every interaction.** JS errors that don't surface visually are still bugs.
7. **Test like a user.** Use realistic data. Walk through complete workflows end-to-end.
8. **Depth over breadth.** 5-10 well-documented issues with evidence > 20 vague descriptions.
9. **Never delete output files.** Screenshots and reports accumulate — that's intentional.
10. **Use \`snapshot -C\` for tricky UIs.** Finds clickable divs that the accessibility tree misses.
11. **Show screenshots to the user.** After every \`$B screenshot\`, \`$B snapshot -a -o\`, or \`$B responsive\` command, use the Read tool on the output file(s) so the user can see them inline. For \`responsive\` (3 files), Read all three. This is critical — without it, screenshots are invisible to the user.`;

function generateDesignReviewLite(): string {
  return `## Design Review (conditional, diff-scoped)

Check if the diff touches frontend files using \`skystack-diff-scope\`:

\`\`\`bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-diff-scope <base> 2>/dev/null)
\`\`\`

**If \`SCOPE_FRONTEND=false\`:** Skip design review silently. No output.

**If \`SCOPE_FRONTEND=true\`:**

1. **Check for DESIGN.md.** If \`DESIGN.md\` or \`design-system.md\` exists in the repo root, read it. All design findings are calibrated against it — patterns blessed in DESIGN.md are not flagged. If not found, use universal design principles.

2. **Read \`.claude/skills/review/design-checklist.md\`.** If the file cannot be read, skip design review with a note: "Design checklist not found — skipping design review."

3. **Read each changed frontend file** (full file, not just diff hunks). Frontend files are identified by the patterns listed in the checklist.

4. **Apply the design checklist** against the changed files. For each item:
   - **[HIGH] mechanical CSS fix** (\`outline: none\`, \`!important\`, \`font-size < 16px\`): classify as AUTO-FIX
   - **[HIGH/MEDIUM] design judgment needed**: classify as ASK
   - **[LOW] intent-based detection**: present as "Possible — verify visually or run /design-review"

5. **Include findings** in the review output under a "Design Review" header, following the output format in the checklist. Design findings merge with code review findings into the same Fix-First flow.

6. **Log the result** for the Review Readiness Dashboard:

\`\`\`bash
eval $(~/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-slug 2>/dev/null)
mkdir -p ~/.skystack/projects/$SLUG
echo '{"skill":"design-review-lite","timestamp":"TIMESTAMP","status":"STATUS","findings":N,"auto_fixed":M}' >> ~/.skystack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl
\`\`\`

Substitute: TIMESTAMP = ISO 8601 datetime, STATUS = "clean" if 0 findings or "issues_found", N = total findings, M = auto-fixed count.`;
}


function generateReviewDashboard(): string {
  return `## Review Readiness Dashboard

After completing the review, read the review log and config to display the dashboard.

eval $(~/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-slug 2>/dev/null)
cat ~/.skystack/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_REVIEWS"
echo "---CONFIG---"
~/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-config get skip_eng_review 2>/dev/null || echo "false"
\`\`\`

Parse the output. Find the most recent entry for each skill (review, pm, design, design-review-lite). Ignore entries with timestamps older than 7 days. For Design Review, show whichever is more recent between \`design\` (full visual audit) and \`design-review-lite\` (inline check). Append "(FULL)" or "(LITE)" to the status to distinguish. Display:

**Review tiers:**
- **Dev Review (required by default):** The only review that gates shipping. Covers architecture, code quality, tests, security. Run with \`/review\`. Can be disabled globally with \\\`skystack-config set skip_eng_review true\\\` (the "don't bother me" setting).
- **PM Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend for new features where a product spec was written with \`/pm\`. Skip for bug fixes, refactors, and cleanup.
- **Design Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend for UI/UX changes. Run with \`/design\`. Skip for backend-only or infra changes.

**Verdict logic:**
- **CLEARED**: Dev Review has >= 1 entry within 7 days with status "clean" (or \\\`skip_eng_review\\\` is \\\`true\\\`)
- **NOT CLEARED**: Dev Review missing, stale (>7 days), or has open issues
- PM and Design reviews are shown for context but never block shipping

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 3.4. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Use AskUserQuestion:
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → write \`.skystack/no-test-bootstrap\` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Select best practices

Use this knowledge table to choose the right framework for the detected runtime:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Use AskUserQuestion:
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → write \`.skystack/no-test-bootstrap\`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete \`.skystack/no-test-bootstrap\` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → revert with \`git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json\` (or equivalent for the runtime). Warn user and continue without tests.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** \`git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10\`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never \`expect(x).toBeDefined()\` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

\`\`\`bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
\`\`\`

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → revert all bootstrap changes and warn user.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

\`\`\`bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
\`\`\`

If \`.github/\` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create \`.github/workflows/test.yml\` with:
- \`runs-on: ubuntu-latest\`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update CLAUDE.md

First check: If CLAUDE.md already has a \`## Testing\` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a \`## Testing\` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

\`\`\`bash
git status --porcelain
\`\`\`

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
\`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"\`

function generateStackDetect(): string {
  return `## Step 0: Detect project stack

Detect the project's technology stack so all research, recommendations, and implementation
are tailored to the right ecosystem. Check for a cached result first.

\`\`\`bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
_SD=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-stack-detect" ] && _SD="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-stack-detect"
[ -z "$_SD" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-stack-detect ] && _SD=~/.claude/skills/skystack/bin/skystack-stack-detect
[ -n "$_SD" ] && "$_SD" || echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
\`\`\`

**If NEEDS_SETUP:** Tell the user: "skystack needs a one-time build. Run \`./setup\` in the skystack directory." and stop.

**If CACHED:** Read the JSON and use it. Print "Stack: {summary from cache}" and continue.

**If DETECTING:** Parse the output lines. Build a stack profile with these fields:
- **stack**: Primary framework (flutter, nextjs, rails, swiftui, react-native, etc.)
- **ui**: UI framework (swiftui, uikit, jetpack-compose, react, vue, material, cupertino)
- **platforms**: Target platforms (ios, android, web, desktop)
- **runtime**: Backend language if applicable
- **lang**: Primary language (dart, typescript, swift, kotlin, etc.)
- **css**: CSS framework if applicable (tailwind, etc.)
- **has_design_system**: Whether DESIGN.md exists

Save the result:

\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p .skystack
cat > .skystack/stack.json << 'STACK_EOF'
{detected JSON here}
STACK_EOF
echo "Stack detected and cached to .skystack/stack.json"
\`\`\`

Print a one-line summary: "Stack: Flutter (iOS + Android), Dart, Material Design" or
"Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind" etc.

**Use the detected stack throughout this skill** to tailor:
- Accessibility guidance (Semantics vs .accessibilityLabel vs contentDescription)
- Chart/visualization libraries (fl_chart vs recharts vs Charts framework)
- Design patterns (Material vs Cupertino vs web component libraries)
- Build/test commands
- Platform-specific considerations
